## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `docs/index.html`: static, self-contained account dashboard for GitHub Pages with ten views
  (Overview, Heroes, Drill Camp, Army & marches, Defense & Arena, City, Invest, Features,
  Data health, Codes) and a hero detail drawer. Phone-first, light/dark/auto theme, no build step.
- All dashboard content lives in one `KS_DATA` JSON block (hand-written for now, snapshot of 21 Oct 2026),
  so a future generator can replace it without touching layout or logic.
- `docs/SCHEMA.md`: field-by-field reference for `KS_DATA`.
- `design/dashboard-prototype.dc.html`: the approved design prototype the page was built from.
