# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `docs/index.html`: static, self-contained account dashboard for GitHub Pages with ten views
  (Overview, Heroes, Drill Camp, Army & marches, Defense & Arena, City, Invest, Features,
  Data health, Codes) and a hero detail drawer. Phone-first, light/dark/auto theme, no build step.
- All dashboard content lives in one `KS_DATA` JSON block (hand-written for now, snapshot of 21 Oct 2026),
  so a future generator can replace it without touching layout or logic.
- `docs/SCHEMA.md`: field-by-field reference for `KS_DATA`.
- `design/dashboard-prototype.dc.html`: the approved design prototype the page was built from.
- `scripts/build_data.py`: generator that builds `KS_DATA` from `profile.md`, `hero.md`, `troops.md`,
  `lineups.md`, `codes.md` and `data/manual.json`, and writes `build/index.html`. Missing values become
  `null` with a warning; a manual/parsed collision, a missing template block or a Player ID leak stops the
  build. Standard library only. Tests in `scripts/test_build_data.py`.
- `data/manual.json`: hand-edited content that is a judgment or a community rule rather than game data
  (recommendations, data-health notes, rules, features, Drill Camp, meta settings, hero notes), seeded
  with the values previously hand-written in `docs/index.html`.
- `.github/workflows/build-dashboard.yml`: on push to `main` (root `.md` files, `data/manual.json`,
  `docs/**`, `scripts/**`, the workflow) or manual run, tests and runs the generator and deploys `build/`
  to GitHub Pages. Read-only on the repository; never commits.
- `as_of:` front matter in the five `.md` files (2026-10-21 for all, as a placeholder until the
  in-game read dates are confirmed).
- `.gitignore` for `build/` and Python bytecode.

### Changed
- `hero.md`: Chenko promoted to 3-Star Tier 4; Gordon's Culinary Chaos and Amane's Exorcism reach Lv. 3;
  Yeonwoo and Saul equip Windbreaker Leatherwear in the empty chest slot.
- `lineups.md`: Arena offensive squad power is now 2,383,515, and Chenko is listed at 3-Star (T4).
- `docs/index.html`: `KS_DATA` updated to match these changes (Chenko, Gordon, Yeonwoo, Amane, Saul,
  Arena attack power), including the recommendation and data-health text that quoted the old values.
- Jabel: Lv. 54 (cap until Town Center Lv. 21), power 564,200, troop capacity +11,525, boots enhanced
  to +20; stats updated in `hero.md`, her level in `lineups.md` and `troops.md`, and her `KS_DATA` entry.
- `profile.md`, `hero.md`, `lineups.md`, `troops.md`, `codes.md`: every value now shows when it was last
  uploaded (an **Updated** column in tables, _(YYYY-MM-DD)_ after other values). Initial dates come from
  git history; all current values were uploaded on 2026-10-21. README documents the convention.
- `codes.md`: Kingshot888, VIP777, KS1005, WELLDONE and Hangul2026 marked redeemed, matching the dashboard.
- Dashboard data now comes from the generator, so it shows more of what the `.md` files hold: every hero's
  generation and role, all four gear slots, one entry per skill, the next promotion step for 14 of 15
  heroes, and all 22 expired codes.
- `docs/index.html`: the hero drawer says "All slots recorded." instead of "Other slots: Not recorded."
  when `gear.slotsComplete` is true.
- `docs/SCHEMA.md`: `gear.slotsComplete`, `generation` as a number, and a "Where each field comes from"
  section with every parsing rule.
- `README.md`: architecture, data-update steps and the GitHub Pages setting for the generator.

### Removed
- The Player ID, from `README.md` (the `profile.md` description) and from `profile.md` (the "Player ID" row).
  It remains in the git history of earlier commits.
